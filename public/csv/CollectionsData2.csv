Maple Island is just off the Canadian shore of Lake Superior.Tree-lined paths lead down to the water, creating a canopy  overhead.  In the Autumn, the colours are brilliant - oak and maple trees colour the island in spectacular shades of red, gold, orange and green.  The fabric line conveys these autumnal colours.

Abby Rose,"by Robin Pickens. Her garden was full of happiness, colour, sweetness and love.
Have you stopped to smell the roses lately? Take a moment and enjoy the soft pink of their delicate petals and the lovely fragrance that brings sweetness to the air.
Abby Rose was designed as a sister collection of Blushing Peonies. I wanted to capture the full pink blooms and deeply layered petals of these glorious blossoms. Cabbage roses seemed to fill that request for colour and beauty. Big, full roses in pretty colors. They remind me of a cottage garden with brambling vines and plants filled with charm. To go with that cottage-feel, a cheery painted plaid is one of the coordinates, along with little rose buds yet to open and ditsy leaves. Sweeping simple lines on one of the prints remind me of the sweet fragrance wafting through the air in a gentle breeze.
I wanted these cabbage roses to still have a pop of color and liveliness so the soft pink and cream backgrounds are joined by lively orange, vibrant green, serene seafoam and a deep prussian blue for vibrancy and drama. I love the play between pink and orange, orange and green, seafoam and dark blue, either to tell a two-toned colour story or create a colorfully rich mix of all the springy shades, setting the stage for the big luscious cabbage roses. So stop, smell the roses, drink in the colours, and enjoy a cottage garden with Abby Rose.

Biscuits and Gravy,"by Basic Grey

From scratch and farm-fresh, Biscuits & Gravy is the perfect blend of supreme comfort and American down-home goodness. It's just so delicious and decadently rich, we love the way it warms our heart and home! I have so many fond memories of the delicious foods my grandma would make.  Applesauce cookies? They were one of my favourites. But grandma's biscuits and gravy is my idea of the all-time supreme comfort food. With that in mind, I set out to create a collection that would look and feel exactly like biscuits and gravy tastes. Indescribably flaky biscuits topped with a rich, creamy sausage gravy. How can that not translate 
into awesome fabric? 

Who wouldn't want to snuggle up with that?

Inspired by spring and early summer when the buds have blossomed and  everything feels fresh and new.

To live in a cottage or farmhouse surrounded by flower gardens and cozy soft colors is a dream of mine. No matter where you might live, being able to bring some softness into our daily lives is a way of taking a deep breath, of welcoming tranquility and comfort.
With fresh colorways of linen white, willow, mist, pebble, and blossom, Bramble Cottage envelops these airy, fresh, cozy feels for your home, and to share with those you love.

Deborah Louie,"Deborah’s love of colour, sewing and textiles started when she was a girl growing up in the family textiles business in Sydney which specialised in hand dyeing laces and beautiful fabrics.
Deborah studied colour and design at college before commencing work in the textile printing industry, but her true passion was found later when she spent time at home with her young family and fell in love with quilting. Deborah started her own domestic machine quilting business, quilting over 600 quilts for clients, which developed her skill in both traditional and contemporary design. Inspired by the river and natural bushland of her Sydney studio, and by her life and love of colour and design, Deborah believes quilting is a labour of love, and each quilt is a beautiful piece of textile decorative art to add to your home or a gift for a special friend.
As an acclaimed and multi award winning quilting designer and tutor with over 25 years of happy stitching, Deborah loves nothing more than to create new designs and teach quilting across Australia. Deborah’s designs challenge quilters of all skill levels and help them to really make the best of the wonderful capabilities of their sewing machines!",,,,https://www.quiltdirect.co.uk/acatalog/PSHeadB.jpg,DLHeadB.jpg,Deborah-Louie.html

Dover,"Dover By Brenda Riddle

Dover, the colours (& name) are originally  inspired by the iconic ‘White Cliffs of Dover’ in England.  Tranquil, misty hues of soft whites, sea glass blue, soft green, & pebble greys create a palette that provides a soft & comforting foundation for quilts, clothing, & home furnishings.

The crossing of the British Channel & the sight of the White Cliffs symbolized an arrival home & served as a sign of security, inspiration, hope and freedom for centuries.",,,,https://www.quiltdirect.co.uk/acatalog/NN301A.jpg,DOVERGROUPA.jpg,Dover.html

Fabric,"So what is the best type of fabric to use for face Masks?  Quilting cottons work well as they are 100% cotton, are tightly woven and are washable.  We would recommend AGF Fabric and 200-thread-count muslins have a higher thread count so they are very well-suited for face masks - they are also very soft. AGF Fabrics are also OEKO-TEX certified which means they only use safe inks for your skin and the planet. We also sell Albstoffe Protect-Me Trevira© Bioactive Technical Fabric. Trevira-Bioactive contains fibres with silver ions firmly integrated within them, which have an antimicrobial effect and thus inhibit the growth of bacteria. This ensures the fabric remains permanently fresh after many washes and is odour free. Trevira-Bioactive is manufactured as a continuous microfilament with many tiny capillaries which gives good filter performance. The Fabric is stretchy, breathable and hard-wearing, making it a great fabric for use when making face masks.

Face Masks,"!!<<strong>>!!Welcome to our Face Masks Section.!!<</strong>>!!
Due to customer demand we have created this dedicated section on our website, here you will find all the various sewing tools and notions that have been requested by customers, along with handy mask patterns, hints and tips. While we cannot guarantee the effectiveness of a homemade face mask, they still provide some protection against the spread of the Covid19 virus. Homemade masks are not considered PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and cannot be worn by medical professionals unless there are no other options available.
 
!!<<strong>>!!Fabrics!!<</strong>>!!.  Quilting cottons work well as they are 100% cotton, are tightly woven and are washable.  AGF Fabric and 200-thread-count muslins have a higher thread count so they are very well-suited for face masks - they are also very soft. AGF Fabrics are also OEKO-TEX certified which means they only use safe inks for your skin and the planet. Gauze, double-gauze and loosely woven fabrics are not recommended to be used. As your face mask will be laundered frequently, so it is necessary to pre-shrink the fabric.  If you like starching your fabrics before sewing with them, that is not a problem so long as the finished face mask is laundered before it is donated and/or worn. We also sell Albstoffe Protect-Me Trevira© Bioactive Technical Fabric. Trevira-Bioactive contains fibres with silver ions firmly integrated within them, which have an antimicrobial effect and thus inhibit the growth of bacteria. This ensures the fabric remains permanently fresh after many washes and is odour free. Trevira-Bioactive is manufactured as a continuous microfilament with many tiny capillaries which gives good filter performance. The Fabric is stretchy, breathable and hard-wearing, making it a great fabric for use when making face masks. 
 
!!<<strong>>!!Linings.!!<</strong>>!!  There are differing opinions on whether this is necessary, or even desirable.  Additional layers of fabric will inhibit microbes from passing through the mask but there comes a point where each additional layer provides only minimal improvement.  The other consideration is breathability.  Some people have been using interfacing interlining which can be sew-in or ironed onto the inside of the mask. We would like to note that although we sell interfacing, we must point out it was not designed for this use. 

!!<<strong>>!!Ties.!!<</strong>>!! There is a variety of different ways to tie on a mask dependent upon the pattern you choose to use.  The most popular way has been to sew elastic or thread it through the mask. We have listened to feed back from people wearing masks for a prolonged period of time and to ease the pressure around the ears we have been attaching buttons to either a section of ribbon which can be worn across the back of the head and the elastic attached to the buttons or headbands with buttons sewn on and used in the same way. We also stock 100% cotton tape which is a great alternative to elastic, it can be sewn onto the mask and tied behind the back of the head.

First Romance,"by Kristyne Czepuryk

Kristyne made her first quilt when she was 19, and as she puts it ""I'm a walking cliché."" She married her high school sweetheart, became a stay at home mom, is inspired by her two daughters and PINK is her favourite colour! After the birth of her second daughter, she decided to make herself a new diaper bag. From there, she ended up selling her own original designs--handbags, wallets, pillows and more! She then taught bag-making classes and over the next 10 years has made many display quilts, wrote an embroidery book, started a pattern company and can't seem to step away from fabric, embroidery thread and her sewing machine! Kristyne is always looking for that next pretty thing to make!

Flour Garden,"By Linzee Kull McCray

Gardens during the feed sack era were practical—planted with foods to sustain a family during hard times. But there was always room for beauty. Along with rows of cucumbers, tomatoes, and potatoes, flowers grew. Iris, morning glories, hollyhocks, and daisies filled backyard borders and vases on kitchen tables. In an era when women meticulously stitched their family’s clothing, quilts, and household goods from flour sacks, they took time to add rick-rack to a dishtowel or embroider a baby chick on a child’s romper. In the toughest of conditions, they made space for beauty and creativity.
 Flour Garden evokes that era of adding a handmade touch on the busiest of days. And whether you use it to stitch quilts, skirts, or tote bags for the farmer’s market, you’ll be sewing your own seeds of artistry and springtime abundance.

Geometry,"By Janet Clare

""I've never particularly got along with maths"".  At school Pythagoras, trigonometry, algebra and equations just made me feel a bit thick. So, it’s quite amusing that I now spend a good part of my life doing just that: calculating areas and angles, dividing, multiplying and then adding that pesky quarter inch to everything! I do love maths equipment though; the rulers, protractors, compasses and best of all- the graph paper. Give me some indigo ink and a piece of squared paper and I am very happy. ‘Geometry’ features isosceles triangles, right angles, quadrants and cubes all painted by hand on my favourite graph paper in my favourite colours with the addition of a nice sharp green for  added flair. I did my homework before naming the colours for this collection. Do you know who they’re named after? (Archimedes, Euclid, Pythagaras, Pascal, and Buckminster)

Holliberry,"By Corey Yoder. There is something special about winter, when a fresh blanket of snow quietly envelops dark gray trees and and branches.  Holliberry adds the bright reds and greens of the Christmas holiday to that backdrop.
Corey Yoder says, ""The holiday season is one of my favorite times of the year.  Of course, I think I say that when each season returns, winter, spring, summer, fall.  I love them all.  Still, there is something special about winter when a fresh blanket of snow quietly envelops the dark gray trees and branches.  Holliberry begins with that imagery, the snowy whites and grays of freshly fallen snow, clouds, and trees.  Against that backdrop, I added the brightly hued reds and greens of the season with holly, berries, poinsettias, and pine.  This collection includes basic prints that mix with other collections as well as sweet holiday florals.  You know my love of stripes so I had to have a perfect candy cane stripe to use for all of those quilt bindings.  I hope Holliberry invites you to reminisce about holidays past and cherish those to come.  Holiday wishes from my family to yours"".

Interfacing,"We have added Interfacings to our Face Mask Section as some patterns are suggesting they sit inside the mask as a lining. There are differing opinions on whether this is necessary, or even desirable.  Additional layers of fabric will inhibit microbes from passing through the mask but there comes a point where each additional layer provides only minimal improvement. The other consideration is breathability. Some people have been using interfacing interlining which can be sew-in or ironed onto the inside of the mask. We would like to note that although we sell interfacing, we must point out it was not designed for this use. ",,,,https://www.quiltdirect.co.uk/acatalog/JJ1100X.jpg,GBV310.jpg,Interfacing.html

Karen is from Northam Bay Quilting and has been an enthusiastic crafter all of her adult life. Following a 30 year career in teaching she has now chosen to use those skills to pass on her passion for patchwork and quilting. She has long been interested in die-cutting and has found success in using the Accuquilt Fabric Cutting System. Karen is noted for her imaginative designs using dies in innovative and unexpected ways and will be demonstrating her skills in these half day sessions.

Lake Views,"By Holly Taylor. There is no better place to be than over-looking the peace and tranquility of the lake. As the morning sun comes up over the horizon you can see the fish making ripples on the lake. If you are lucky, you might hear the call of the loon or spot their family gliding along the water. An afternoon canoeing around the lake is on the agenda, and a bonfire on the shore ends a perfect day. We love spending time with this Lakeview.",,,,https://www.quiltdirect.co.uk/acatalog/GB2V306.jpg,LAKEGROUPA.jpg,Lake-Views.html

Nicholas Ball,"Nicholas Ball is a fabric addict from Cardiff, South Wales. After graduating Art School in 2006, it would be some six years before the quilting bug bit. With a passion for improv quilting, Nicholas' aesthetic is an organic one, preferring to sew without the use of patterns or templates. He takes a lot of inspiration from natural world and his Vegetable Patch quilts showcase his love for liberated sewing. He has taught improv quilting both nationally and internationally, contributed to the UK leading quilting magazines and was a co-presenter of the QNNTV show ‘Quilt Monkey’, alongside fellow UK quilter Katy Jones. His debut book ‘Inspiring Improv’ was published in April 2019 and his co-ordinating Aurifil thread collection followed in August.",,,,https://www.quiltdirect.co.uk/acatalog/DLHeadB.jpg,NBHeadB.jpg,Tracy-Pereira.html

The classic Christmas colors are given a modern Scandi vibe to create a look that will last through the winter. Northern Light will bring seasonal cheer into your home wherever in the world you might be.

Made of durable acrylic plastic with both neon and black printing which allows the user to see the grid on both light and dark fabrics. Features a left- and right-handed numbering system and bias lines oriented to the bottom of the ruler. This eliminates the need to flip and turn the ruler to use both sets of diagonal lines.

Redwork Gatherings,"Redwork Gatherings By Primitive Gatherings

I love red and white quilts, so much so that I knew I had to create fabrics inspired by the antique quilts in my collection.  A treasured antique Redwork quilt inspired a panel that can be used for so many things.  If you love slow-stitching – and you know I do – the blocks can be stitched, or they can be left as they are.  The designs can also be used as the center squares of pieced blocks, the possibilities are endless!    
The colors and prints are true to their vintage roots – small-scale, shirting style prints in two shades of deep red.  The fabrics have the time-worn shading that I love, it makes my new quilts look and feel like antiques.  I hope Redwork Gatherings inspires its way into your next quilt.

Regency Romance,"By Christopher Wilson-Tate.
Christopher's collection of antique quilts reflect his extensive travels through the British Isles.
His many English Georgian and Regency-period quilts contain designs dating from 1770 to 1820, designs that have been faithfully reproduced for Regency Romance. Reminiscent of the romantic era of Jane Austen in colour and scale, each print bears a well-known name from the period – Emma, Jane, Emily and Diana.  The original quilt that inspired this collection is over 200 years old, and is a beautiful, faded floral English chintz patchwork from the Regency Period.

Whatever Rosewood means to you... we hope it is something beautiful.

This is a range of rulers that Katherine found at Houston Quilt Market, and she was so impressed by the concept and design that we think they will be a useful addition to many quick piecers' ruler collections!  We know you think you have every possible ruler, but being able to trim pieced units down to the exact size with a foolproof method so quickly and with only the tiniest bit of waste is really impressive.  

We recommend you try one - we think you will be back for more!

Sunday Picnic,"Sunday Picnic, By Stacy Iest Hsu. 
Often times inspiration can come in the most unexpected ways and that is definitely true for my latest collection Sunday Picnic.
My dad decided to plant 20 acres of California Poppies behind their house. My brothers and I lovingly referred to it as the ""Field of Dreams"" as this is something my dad had wanted to do for a long time. This last spring, my parents field turned into a true field of dreams. A brilliant glow of orange could be seen from far and wide, and it actually made the inside of their home glow as well. It was spectacular! One of my brothers had suggested having a picnic in the field, and at that very moment Sunday Picnic was born.

Bright floral patterns and picnic themed prints are the subject of this collection. If you look very closely you will even find some poppies in some of the prints. 

A picnic would not be complete without the basket and all the fixin’s and this collection delivers. Not only is there a cut-and-sew basket with food, there are also two sweet frogs to keep you company on your picnic. Here's to slowing down and enjoying time with friends and family with a perfect Sunday Picnic.

Sue started sewing from an early age and has always loved making things with fabric.  Her first love has always been Quilting, however she has worked making luxury underwear and has owned her own curtain, furnishing and craft businesses. She has also taught dressmaking and tailoring.
 
Sue attended the Festival of Quilts in Birmingham in 2015 and watched Westalee Rulers being demonstrated. She was so impressed she had to buy them and never looked back. She fell in love with the design process and was awarded the status of a Westalee Design Accredited Teacher in the UK. She feels very lucky to be able to teach people so that they can also make beautiful things and watch them flourish with excitement when they first try.

Thread is a very important component in any sewing project, it literally ties everything all together! The correct thread type in the best quality is an investment in your time, your equipment and your project.

When doing a small amount of hand or machine sewing the quality of a particular thread may not be paramount. However hours of hand or machine piecing or quilting will soon show the 'true colours' of a cheap or inferior quality thread.  Tangles, breaks, fraying and a lint build up in the bobbin area of your precious sewing machine will add frustration and disappointment to your valuable sewing time. 

Quality threads are an investment that should not be overlooked, we only offer quality threads that we use ourselves in our own work.

Through the Years continues with the theme of celebrating my 20th Anniversary with Moda in 2020. My classic Kansas Troubles palette is brightened up with lighter tan backgrounds to contrast with my signature nature-inspired colors. 
My inspiration comes from my love for charming floral prints in all the glorious shades of spring, they set the tone for this collection.

Triangles on a Roll,"Triangles on a Roll grid paper is the answer to the half-square and quarter square triangle dilemma.  It offers the most efficient and flexible method for making triangles.  The paper is a pattern for sewing and cutting.  It is printed on a roll of paper that enables you to make as many or as few triangles as you want with two different fabrics, or use two to four different fabrics for quarter square triangles. No more cutting on the bias, no more measuring and cutting 7/8 inches, all seam allowances are included in the pattern.  All you have to do is select your fabrics, pin them together with the paper, sew and cut!  You will have accurate half square or quarter square triangles in a jiffy with a minimum of hassle. 

All sizes refer to the  ""Finished Size"" of the unit block ie 2"" half square triangles will finish up as a square 2""x 2"" plus a seam allowance of ¼"" on four sides.",Triangles On A Roll,Paper for foundation piecing triangles.
